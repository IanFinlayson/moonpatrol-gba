# Moon Patrol GBA
A Game Boy Advance version of the old [Moon Patrol arcade game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol).
It should run in any Game Boy Advance emulator (tested with Visual Boy Advance).
It also runs on the hardware directly (with a special cartridge).
The game is finished now.  It does not do everything that could be desired such
as letting the player shoot the obstacles or have multiple levels/enemies etc.
But I don't think I will get around to doing any of that.
