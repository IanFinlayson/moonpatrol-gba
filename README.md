# Moon Patrol GBA
A Game Boy Advance version of the old [Moon Patrol arcade game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol).
It should run in any Game Boy Advance emulator (tested with Visual Boy Advance).
The game is finished now.  It does not do everything that could be desired such
as letting the player shoot the obstacles or have multiple levels/enemies etc.
But I don't think I will get around to doing any of that.

## Running
Just load the .gba file into any Game Boy Advance emulator.  I tested in
Visual Boy Advance.  I have also tested on an actual GBA as well.


## Build Requirements
- [DevKit Advance](http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net/)
- [My PNG to GBA image converter](https://github.com/IanFinlayson/png2gba)
